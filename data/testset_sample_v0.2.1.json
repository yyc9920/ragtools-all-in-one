   "reference":"The optimization and quantization techniques, including mixed precision quantization, static uniform quantization, and various conversion processes, are compared in terms of performance and efficiency across different reports for models using Linux, Ubuntu 22.04, and NVIDIA Container Toolkit by evaluating their ability to enhance model performance through methods like shape inference, 4D conversion, and various optimization techniques. Mixed precision quantization allows for different precision levels for activations and weights, while static uniform quantization applies a fixed precision across the model. The performance is assessed before and after optimization and quantization, with advanced methods like SmoothQuant and Cross Layer Equalization used to mitigate quantization errors. The process involves converting models to different formats (ONNX, CNNX, SNC) and using tools like EHT and enntools for optimization and conversion.",
